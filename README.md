# Coronavirus-live-updator
This project is a combination of Hardware and Software Implementation.At first I got the Coronavirus Live count from WorldOMeter
website using the Web Scarping and then sent this count to arduino which displayed the count on 16,2 LCD screen.
But how did the python send the count to arduino, here comes a communicator between these two which is ESP32 implented BoltIOT
this is same as ESP32 but it adds a layer of abstraction so it can be programmed with python.(Using API)
